# Challenge Day 1
[Build a drum kit](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/59e63178789cae180d436a72/view/194130650). All daily challenge's files are given, except for the javascript one. The task is watch the video and then reproduce the component by filling the script tags.

My goal is to become better at Javacript so I write plain Javascript everyday for 30 days with [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com/), a course/challenge created by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) :sparkles:
